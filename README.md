# Bayesian Spatial temporal Analysis for Dengue Fever in Brazil during 2015-2019

This ecological study employs Bayesian hierarchical models and spatial generalized linear mixed-effect models (GLMMs) to analyse the spatial-temporal dynamics of dengue fever in Brazil from 2015 to 2019. Using data from 557 microregions over 60 months, we aim to investigate the relationships between climatic variables (monthly maximum temperature and Palmerâ€™s drought severity index) and dengue incidence. Despite identifying high-risk areas primarily in Southeast and Centre-West regions, the periodic outbreak pattern observed did not exhibit a clear yearly trend. The chosen spatial-temporal model with type I interaction and two covariates accurately predicted dengue cases. Our findings provide valuable insights into dengue transmission patterns and highlight the importance of comprehensive modelling approaches in informing public health interventions and policy decisions.
